# Multi-PDF_Exporter
This script was developped to smoothen the process of exporting Illustrator file into multiple PDF files at once, while each PDF can use its own PDF export settings.
While its main purpose is indeed to do multiple PDF export at once, as it allows to save multiple export profile it also speeds up the process of exporting
recurrent single PDF file, specially when you need standarized file names and PDF settings.
This version is adding the support of datasets, as well as improving the file naming possibilities. It also supports the merging of multiple artboards to export
into single PDF file (one artboard per page). The export method was rebuild from scratch to improve stability and reduce the risks of damaging the original
.AI file.
The scipt was developped in Javasrcript, using Adobe ExtendScript Toolkit CC.
